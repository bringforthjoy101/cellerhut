# Scanner Context Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of a global scanner context to resolve barcode scanning conflicts between multiple components in the inventory application.

## Problem Statement

**Issue**: Multiple scanner instances were running simultaneously, causing scanned products to be populated into search bars instead of being directly added to the picker order sidebar.

**Root Cause**: 
- The picker page (`index.js`) was using `useUniversalScanner` to add products to orders
- The ecommerce ProductsSearchbar was also using `useUniversalScanner` and falling back to populating search fields when products weren't found
- Multiple components were competing for the same scanner callbacks

## Solution

### 1. Global Scanner Context Provider

Created `src/contexts/ScannerContext.js` to manage a single scanner instance globally:

```javascript
// Key features:
- Single scanner instance for the entire application
- Priority-based handler registration system
- Automatic handler switching based on priority
- Comprehensive debugging and status tracking
```

**Priority System**:
- **Picker page**: Priority 10 (highest)
- **Product forms/editing**: Priority 5 (medium)
- **Ecommerce shop**: Priority 1 (lowest)

### 2. Updated Components

#### Picker Page (`src/views/tiki-fish/picker/index.js`)
- **Before**: Used `useUniversalScanner` directly
- **After**: Uses `useScannerHandler` with priority 10
- **Behavior**: When active, all scanned products are added directly to the order sidebar

#### ProductsSearchbar (`src/views/tiki-fish/ecommerce/shop/ProductsSearchbar.js`)
- **Before**: Populated search field as fallback when products not found
- **After**: Removed search field fallback, defers to higher priority handlers
- **Priority**: 1 (only active when no higher priority handlers are present)

#### Product Forms
- **Product Creation Sidebar**: Priority 5, enabled only when sidebar is open
- **Product Edit Form**: Priority 5, always enabled when component is mounted
- **ProductCards**: Priority 5, for adding products to cart

### 3. Integration

#### App Level (`src/App.js`)
```javascript
<ScannerProvider>
  <Router />
</ScannerProvider>
```

#### Component Usage Pattern
```javascript
// Register as scanner handler
useScannerHandler('component-id', callbackFunction, priority, enabled)

// Access scanner context
const { isConnected, activeHandlerId, ... } = useScannerContext()
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Conflict Resolution**
- Only one scanner handler is active at a time
- No more competing callbacks causing unexpected behavior
- Clear priority system ensures correct handler gets barcode data

### 2. **Predictable Behavior**
- **On Picker Page**: Scanned products → Order sidebar ✓
- **On Ecommerce Shop**: Scanned products → Shopping cart ✓
- **In Product Forms**: Scanned barcodes → Form fields ✓

### 3. **Developer Experience**
- Debug component shows active handler and scanner status (development only)
- Clear logging for troubleshooting
- Centralized scanner management

### 4. **Automatic Cleanup**
- Handlers are automatically unregistered when components unmount
- Context switches to next highest priority handler
- No memory leaks or stale references

## Testing

### Build Verification
```bash
npm run build
# ✅ Compiled successfully
```

### Debug Component
Added `ScannerDebugInfo` component (development only) that shows:
- Scanner connection status
- Active handler information
- Number of registered handlers
- Scanner service details

## Usage Guidelines

### For New Components
```javascript
import { useScannerHandler, useScannerContext } from 'path/to/contexts/ScannerContext'

const MyComponent = () => {
  const handleBarcode = (barcode, serviceName, scannerType) => {
    console.log(`Barcode received: ${barcode}`)
    // Handle barcode logic here
  }

  // Register with appropriate priority
  useScannerHandler('my-component', handleBarcode, 5, true)

  // Access scanner status if needed
  const { isConnected, activeHandlerId } = useScannerContext()

  return <div>...</div>
}
```

### Priority Guidelines
- **10**: Critical components that must handle all scans (e.g., Picker page)
- **5**: Form components that need barcode input
- **1**: Background components that should only handle scans when nothing else is active

## Files Modified

### New Files
- `src/contexts/ScannerContext.js` - Global scanner context
- `src/views/tiki-fish/picker/components/ScannerDebugInfo.js` - Debug component

### Modified Files
- `src/App.js` - Added ScannerProvider wrapper
- `src/views/tiki-fish/picker/index.js` - Updated to use scanner context
- `src/views/tiki-fish/ecommerce/shop/ProductsSearchbar.js` - Removed search fallback
- `src/views/tiki-fish/ecommerce/shop/ProductCards.js` - Updated to use context
- `src/views/tiki-fish/product/list/Sidebar.js` - Updated to use context
- `src/views/tiki-fish/product/edit/Account.js` - Updated to use context

## Result

✅ **Problem Solved**: Scanned products on the picker page now go directly to the order sidebar instead of populating search fields.

✅ **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved with improved reliability.

✅ **Better Architecture**: Centralized scanner management with clear separation of concerns.

## Monitoring

The debug component provides real-time visibility into:
- Which component is currently handling scans
- Scanner connection status
- Number of registered handlers

This helps developers quickly identify and resolve any scanning issues during development.
